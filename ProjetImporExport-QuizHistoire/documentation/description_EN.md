**PHP Framework Project - Interactive History Quiz**

# Concept

The project involves creating an interactive web application with the main goal of offering a challenge to users in the form of a history quiz. This application will connect to a database rich in historical facts and works such as books, plays, musical compositions, monuments, paintings, sculptures, and much more.

# How it works

When a user launches the application, it will randomly select an item from the database and display it on the screen, making sure not to reveal its date of occurrence. Just below, three other items will also be randomly chosen, each accompanied by a brief description but without indicating the date of creation or event.

The main challenge for the user will be to determine which of the three items presented at the bottom of the page is the closest, chronologically, to the item displayed at the top. However, to make the game even more interesting, one of the three options will always be relatively close to the proposed item. The placement of this special response will be randomly chosen among the three possible positions (first, second, or third).

The game will consist of ten questions of this type. At the end of the game, all the items presented during the session will be displayed, and each item will be linked to the related Wikipedia article. Although I don't have enough time to create original content, this will allow users to explore further the topics that interest them most.

# Optional feature: login system

The addition of a login system is contemplated, if time permits. Users would not be required to create an account to play the quiz. However, those who choose to register would have access to an additional feature, namely the ability to add new items to the quiz database. A page with a form would allow registered users to submit new entries. Before adding a new item to the database, a moderation step by the webmaster would be necessary to ensure the quality and relevance of additions.

# Objectives and benefits

This project aims to make history learning more interactive and engaging. By challenging users to guess the chronology of events and works, I hope to stimulate their interest in history. The benefits of this project include:
- promoting interactive learning,
- increasing cultural awareness,
- providing an entertaining and educational experience.

# Conclusion

This PHP framework project for an interactive history quiz promises an educational and enriching experience for history enthusiasts and beyond!
